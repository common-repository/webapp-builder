It’s no secret that the share of mobile traffic in overall online activity is soaring. According to a Smart Insights study carried out in 2015, more than half of U.S. digital media consumption is linked to mobile devices.

The same trend is behind the shift towards responsive design over the past few years. However, this effort might not address the whole picture, as surprisingly little of mobile online media is consumed through browsers. On the contrary, according to a study which is already two years old, 47 percent of mobile traffic comes from apps. One might reasonably assume that the number is now higher.
Thankfully, in recent years, solutions that make this process pretty easy have emerged. In this article we will look at five of them, their pros and cons, and what else we can expect in this area in the future.

Pros and cons of mobile app creation services

Before we dive into our list of tools, let’s quickly talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using them.

On the plus side is the price. Since custom app development starts around $5,000 (with no upper limit), cost is usually the biggest deterrent for website owners. In contrast to that, the services below are far more affordable. Plus, they can make the process much quicker. What usually takes weeks and months of back and forth with a developer can often be done within minutes using one of the solutions below.

On the other hand, with a cookie-cutter approach, users are more limited in their design and functionality choices than with a bespoke application.

Nevertheless, in terms of cost effectiveness, the mobile app solutions below are the best choice overall for website owners in most cases.

This first candidate is a development framework for both iOS and Android apps. web app is based on PhoneGap by Adobe, and offers complete WordPress integration. That means many familiar WordPress features can be made available in the end product — including access to the backend, photo upload, BuddyPress integration and more.

Reactor is another solution by , this time for non-coders. It can turn WordPress content into slick mobile mobile-app-native>webapp</a>)s like these. You even get a free trial! However, to continue modifying your mobile-app-native>webapp</a>), send push notifications, and use other Reactor features, you will need a monthly subscription.

Overall, Reactor offers a quick and easy way to create an mobile-app-native>webapp</a>) for your site.

What’s special about this next service is that it enables you to build native Android and iOS mobile-app-native>webapp</a>)lications. That way, you can get your mobile-app-native>webapp</a>)s into the Google and Apple stores more easily.

Features of  include offline content access, the ability to include ads for monetization, and push notifications. In addition, it can also deal with WordPress features like user accounts, custom post types, and commenting.

There’s a monthly fee for plans; however, you can pre-build and view your mobile-app-native>webapp</a>) before handing over money. They also have lifetime licenses for those looking to make a long-term investment.

Creating mobile-app-native>webapp</a>)s for iOS, Android and Blackberry with Mobmobile-app-native>webapp</a>)er is as easy as installing a WordPress plugin on your site. The service enables you to choose from different design templates, and automatically syncs content between your site and its companion mobile-app-native>webapp</a>)lication. You can find examples here.

After a 14-day free trial, plans start at a low monthly fee for one mobile-app-native>webapp</a>) on one platform, making Mobmobile-app-native>webapp</a>)er quite affordable in contrast to other solutions on this list.

Finally, we have IdeaPress, another solution for non-coders to create Android, iOS and Windows apps from your WordPress website. Just install their plugin, and follow the online instructions to design your app and publish it in different stores.

Customize colors, layout, fonts and functionality at will, and the service will automatically update your app when new stuff comes out on your site.

There’s a set price for one site on all three platforms, and it scales up quickly from there.

What to expect in the future

In the upcoming years, the integration of the WP REST API will likely result in more WordPress-based mobile apps.

With the JSON format natively supported by both iOS and Android, turning WordPress into a server from which to pull content will be no problem at all. In fact, we can already see the first examples of this in practice. The services above will likely follow suit at some point, or we will see new services and frameworks coming out that do.

If you are interested in diving deeper into this topic, check out this detailed tutorial on how to build mobile apps with the WP REST API and React.

Summing up

 traffic is a force to be reckoned with, which website owners ignore at their own peril. Besides offering responsive design, having a mobile companion app for your site is another move into a growing market that promises traffic, sales and leads.

Services likes the ones on this list make mobile app creation much easier and more affordable, and the WP REST API will likely further push this trend in the future. Thus, website owners have few excuses not to venture into the app market. Who knows — having an app might be the new default soon.

What problem do we solve?

As soon as publisher decide on setting up an mobile app they face the choice between monotonous low-quality “mobile app builders” lacking the opportunity to create custom designs, because they will never have a chance against apps from professional mobile app agencies. However, agencies and freelancer are slow, changes can be implemented only by the developer and are tremendously expensive. We are a solution to this problem.

What is your solution?

We combine all advantages of mobile app builders, freelancers and agencies and additionally clear up all disadvantages. Sounds great, but let us explain how we achieve this: We offer a sophisticated system allowing publishers to create their very own top-notch native mobile app for their WordPress blog or YouTube channel for ios and android. In addition to that we only charge a small monthly fee and take over the hosting and general technical care. Furthermore, if requested, we develop a completely distinct and exclusive own custom mobile app design hand in hand with our customers - the same applies to specific desired functions. Webapp represents the golden mean between mobile app builders and agencies.
In every area of our lives we recognize the trend to mobiles devices and smartphones. Mobile Devices (Android Apps and iOS Apps) are everywhere and they are talking over task by task. We use a mobile app for communication, a mobile app for entertainment, a mobile app for booking, a mobile app for eating, a mobile app photos, a mobile app for meeting new people and especially a mobile app for getting informations and news on both android and ios.

Did you know that we spend more than 80% in native mobile apps <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mobile-app-builder-by-wappress/">Mobile app</a> when we use our android and ios devices? As a result, less than 20% of our smartphone use time is spend in browsers where people read your blog, and the trend is growing towards a mobile app.

If you are a publisher with a large audience and do not have a mobile app yet, your readers have no possibility to be up-to-date with your news. Only through a native mobile app you can unfilteredly reach your target group through push notifications. In addition to that, a native mobile app creates a whole different feeling when using it. It can use the core advantages of native software and access powerful frameworks and offer tremendous features.

<a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/webapp-builder/">mobile app</a>Since you are on our page, chances are that you have already tried out different mobile app builder solutions. You may have also noticed that a vast majority of mobile app builders are complex to use, look unprofessional and unclean and are very limited in both function and design.

We are bloggers ourselves and also discovered these issues when trying to create a mobile app. You can either use an overpriced mobile app builder or offer a professional agency that takes very long and is very expensive as well.
Its unique approach, though, is clearly aimed at developers so what options exist for those WordPress users who want to deliver their WordPress content via a mobile app but don’t wish to get their hands dirty with PhoneGap?

In this article, I take a look at five other plugins that all deliver a mobile app and discover that if you are willing to compromise the process is surprisingly simple and cost effective.
The simple, easy-to-follow, building process operates entirely on the Webapp website although you will need to install a plugin that provides a JSON API for accessing content for both the building process and the app itself

The customization options allow for basic color selection, selecting the format of the home page and deciding which categories (maximum of 10) and pages to include.

The app features a slick slide-out menu (automatically populated with links to Home and the selected categories and pages), a search function (disconcertingly, on the preview of the app it doesn’t search your site but the generic demo site) and a back button.

The preview app did not seem to recognise any formatting, so posts were displayed as a dump of text with no paragraphs. Whether this is restricted to just the preview, I’m not sure.

Webapp is easy to use and it takes a little more than five minutes to have an app up and running.<a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp2android-turn-wp-site-into-android-app/">mobile plugin</a> The preview, though, is not that inspiring and left me wondering if this was really what my app would look like. Perhaps for $69, I’d be willing to risk it but if you are going to have a preview, and for these tools it’s pretty much essential, then it should be as close to the real thing as possible.

As even Webapp shows, creating an app for the mobile platforms is an involved, technical process that is not for the feint-hearted. Not surprisingly, then, services and their associated plugins have been created to smooth the process and make app publishing available to anyone who wants it.

Even though Webapp is aimed at developers, the basic aim is to produce a mobile app and so it was a little surprising to see some commentators claim that Webapp has no competition. Sure, there are significant differences between the newcomer and the existing plugins and services but they have a common goal: the creation of a mobile app. 
So we thought there has to be a better way and we invented Webapp - the golden mean between mobile app builders and agencies for an android app and an ios app. We offer a strong background system, take care of the whole process of publishing, managing and updating your mobile app for ios and android and offer affordable prices. Furthermore we enable you to better monetize your mobile app for android and ios and earn more money. We do not limit push notifications. Once set up, you never have to worry about your mobile app again. Push notifications are sent completly automatically - no action required. In our strong analytics system you can watch your mobile app growing.

The best thing is that we want you to be happy with your app so we decided not to charge any money until you are 100% satisfied and decide to release your mobile app for ios to the app store and your android app to the play store. You can try and experiment with every function and design your mobile app as long as you like for free and test your android app and ios app on your devices.

Once you are content with your mobile app you can hand it over to us and we will take care of the remaining process. <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp2android-turn-wp-site-into-android-app/">mobile plugin</a>We will hand your iOS App over to Apple and your Android App to Google and offer strong servers that process the content of your mobile app. Your site does not have to struggle with an extra amount of traffic.

Uppsite offers a very comprehensive wizard and configuration options, all from within the WordPress Admin interface.

<a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/webapp-builder/">mobile app</a> That said, there are two issues with the app building process which make it an unsatisfying user experience.

Firstly, although there’s a large superfluous image of an iPhone on every page, it’s not a preview which you would reasonably expect.

Secondly, there’s no access to the many premium features, even just for previewing, without at least signing-up for the 7-day trial which involves providing payment details. Yes, you can cancel but this is an unnecessary hurdle.

The problem is caused by Uppsite offering a free plan that provides an HTML5 app. The premium features apply equally to that app as they do to the mobile app making it difficult for Uppsite to make the premium features previewable on the free account but at the same time preventing them from flowing through to the HTML5 app.

This needs to be addressed because it hinders what looks to be a very promising product.
